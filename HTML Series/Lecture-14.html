    <h1>MEDIA in HTML</h1>
    <h2>Video and Audio</h2>
    <!-- The main difference between <video> and <iframe> elements is that : -->

        <!-- In <video>, Videos are already in the same server as our html Document -->

        <!-- In <iframe>, it means opening a window for displaying a third party video 
        We are only giving a frame without load in our server -->
    <video src=""></video> 

    <!-- OR  -->

    <video width="400" height="300" controls muted autoplay>    
        <source src="./ExampleVideo.mp4">
    </video>
    <!-- We have to use height and width attributes in video element  -->
    <!-- If we want to customize the changes in video controls, Javascript is used -->

<!-- Important -->
    <!-- Live Server will only see the files loaded in the directory. Outside like in the deskstop it doesn't have access to it. -->
    <h2>'Controls' Attribute : Important</h2>
    <!-- 'controls' - Most important when handling media in html only  -->

    <audio src="">    </audio>

    <h3>APIs</h3>
    <p>Note: HTML does not have any type of access to APIs</p>
    <p>WE declare in HTML but its implementation can only be possible using JAVASCRIPT</p>
